# Historical Data

## Overview

Two approaches to accessing historical market data.

## Candles (OHLCV)

Aggregated price data at regular intervals.

- **Intervals**: 1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 4h, 1d
- **Data**: Open, High, Low, Close, Volume
- **Additional**: VWAP, Open Interest (optional)
- **Bar alignment**: How candles align to time boundaries

## Price Series (Tick Data)

Raw tick-level price data for granular analysis.

- Outcome-level (per `token_id` for Polymarket)
- Every price change
- Ideal for custom aggregations and analysis

## When to Use Each

- **Candles**: Charts, technical analysis, OHLC displays
- **Tick data**: Custom indicators, microstructure analysis, research
