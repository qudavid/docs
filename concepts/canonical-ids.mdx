# Canonical IDs & Matching

## Overview

## Key Concepts

### event_uid

Canonical event identifier across all venues.

### market_uid

Canonical market identifier across all venues.

### venue_ids{}

Object containing venue-specific identifiers (e.g., Polymarket slugs, Kalshi tickers).

## Endpoints

Details will be documented here.

### /v1/resolve
