# Historical Time Series

Use Predexon Time Series endpoints to fetch normalized OHLCV candles and per-venue tick data aligned to canonical market IDs.

## Base URLs

- **REST:** `https://api.predexon.com/v1`

## Conventions

For authentication, ID formats, numeric precision, and general pagination guidance, see the [Discovery API Overview](/pages/discovery/overview). Time Series endpoints extend those conventions with:

- **UTC alignment:** All bars and ticks are aligned to UTC timestamps.
- **Cursor pagination:** Both candles and tick endpoints return `next_cursor` values for large exports.
- **Per-venue data:** Responses provide separate blocks per venue when a market is listed in multiple venues.

## Endpoints

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Candles (OHLCV)" icon="chart-candlestick" href="/pages/time-series/candles">
    GET /v1/candles/{market_uid}
  </Card>
  <Card title="Price Series (Ticks)" icon="chart-line" href="/pages/time-series/price-series">
    GET /v1/price-series/{token_id}
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Workflow

1. **Resolve selectors:** Use [Resolve Selectors](/pages/discovery/resolve) to get the canonical `market_uid` and venue tokens.
2. **Fetch candles:** Pull OHLCV via `/v1/candles/{market_uid}` with appropriate intervals.
3. **Fetch tick data:** Request per-venue ticks via `/v1/price-series/{token_id}` for fine-grained analytics.
4. **Combine with Live Data:** Seed historical views, then update using [Stream Quotes](/pages/live-data/stream-quotes).
