## Example Request

List MLB events for a specific date:

  "https://api.predexa.com/v1/events?category=sports/baseball/mlb&date=2025-07-12&limit=100"
```

## Notes

- **Participants** are simple codes in V1 (e.g., team abbreviations, candidate names). These may be enriched in future versions.
- **event_status** reflects the event lifecycle and differs from market `trading_status`.
- **venue_ids** provides native identifiers for each venue, allowing you to "hop" to venue-specific systems when needed.
- **asof** timestamp indicates when this snapshot was captured.
