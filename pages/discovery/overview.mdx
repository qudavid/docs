# Predexon Discovery API

Use Predexon Discovery to find events and normalized markets across venues, then resolve or match venue-native IDs to canonical IDs.

## Base URLs

- **REST**: `https://api.predexon.com/v1`
- **WebSocket**: `wss://stream.predexon.com/v1`

## Conventions

### Time Format
ISO-8601 UTC timestamps (e.g., `2025-10-06T19:21:02Z`)

### Numbers
All numeric fields are strings for fixed precision (e.g., `"0.0010"`, `"1.00"`)

### Pagination
Cursor-based pagination model:

**Request:**
```
?cursor=<opaque_string>&limit=<integer>
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "next_cursor": "eyJpZCI6..."
}
```

No `prev_cursor` in MVP.

### IDs

- **Canonical IDs**: `event_uid`, `market_uid`
- **Venue IDs**: `venue_ids{}` always present for hopping to native IDs

### Authentication

All requests require an authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

## Status Enums

### event_status
- `scheduled` - Event is scheduled but hasn't started
- `live` - Event is currently in progress

### trading_status
