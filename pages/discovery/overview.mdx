title: Predexon Discovery API
description: Unified prediction market data across venues with canonical IDs and normalized schemas.
---

The Discovery API unifies prediction market data across venues like Polymarket and Kalshi into a single, normalized interface.

## Why Discovery?

Each prediction market venue uses its own identifiers and data formats. Discovery solves this by providing:

- **Canonical IDs** - Stable identifiers that work across venues (`event_uid`, `market_uid`)
- **Normalized schemas** - Unified market types (`binary`, `multi`, `numeric`), standardized status fields (`open`, `halted`, `closed`), and ISO-8601 timestamps instead of venue-specific formats
- **Bidirectional mapping** - Convert between canonical IDs and venue-native identifiers (slugs, tickers)

### What Gets Normalized?

Discovery standardizes differences between venues:

| Aspect | Without Discovery | With Discovery |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| **Market types** | Venue-specific `marketType` field values | Consistent `type: "binary"`, `"multi"`, or `"numeric"` |
| **Status representation** | Polymarket: boolean flags (`active`, `closed`), Kalshi: string `status` | Consistent `trading_status: "open"`, `"halted"`, or `"closed"` |
| **Field names** | Polymarket: event `slug`, market `id`; Kalshi: `event_ticker`, `ticker` | Unified field structure with `venue_ids{}` |
| **Price formats** | Kalshi: both integers and dollar strings, Polymarket: mixed | Always string decimals (`"0.5500"`) |

## Understanding IDs

Predexon creates and maintains **canonical IDs** to represent the same real-world event across different venues. Each venue has its own native identifiers that you need when calling their APIs directly.

### Example: The Same MLB Game Across Venues

**Real-world event:** Yankees vs Red Sox on July 12, 2025

**Event-level IDs:**
| ID Type | Value | Where It's Used |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **Canonical Event ID** (Predexon) | `evt_mlb_2025_07_12_NYY_BOS` | Predexon Discovery API |
| **Polymarket Slug** | `mlb-nyy-bos-2025-07-12` | Polymarket API |
| **Kalshi Event Ticker** | `KXMLBGAME-25JUL12NYYBOS` | Kalshi API |

**Market-level IDs** (for "Will Yankees win?" binary market):
| ID Type | Value | Where It's Used |
|---------|-------|-----------------|
| **Canonical Market ID** (Predexon) | `mkt_evt_mlb_2025_07_12_NYY_BOS_winner_nyy` | Predexon Discovery API |
| **Polymarket Market ID** | `123456789` | Polymarket API |
| **Kalshi Series Ticker** | `KXMLBNYY-25JUL12` | Kalshi API |

### Why Two ID Systems?

- **Canonical IDs** let you query once and get data from all venues
- **Venue IDs** let you place orders or fetch venue-specific data (orderbooks, liquidity)
- Discovery provides both in every response via the `venue_ids{}` field

### ID Format Contract

**Canonical IDs are stable and permanent:**
- `event_uid` format: `evt_{category}_{date}_{participants}` (e.g., `evt_nfl_2025_01_26_BUF_KC`)
- `market_uid` format: `mkt_{event_uid}_{outcome}` (e.g., `mkt_evt_nfl_2025_01_26_BUF_KC_winner`)
- IDs never change once assigned, even if event details are updated
- Safe to store and use as primary keys in your database

### When to Use Each

- **Building multi-venue dashboards?** Use canonical IDs to avoid duplicate entries
- **Placing trades on Polymarket?** Use the Polymarket slug from `venue_ids.polymarket`
- **Have a Kalshi ticker and need market data?** Use Resolve/Matching to get the canonical `market_uid`

### Common Workflows

1. **Discover events by category and date** - Use [List Events](/pages/discovery/events) with filters like `category=sports/baseball/mlb&date=2025-07-12` to get canonical `event_uid` values
2. **Find markets for an event** - Use the `event_uid` with [List Markets](/pages/discovery/markets) to get all associated markets with their `venue_ids`
3. **Resolve venue-native IDs** - Have a Polymarket slug or Kalshi ticker? Use [Resolve Selectors](/pages/discovery/resolve) or [Matching Markets](/pages/discovery/matching) to get the canonical `market_uid`
4. **Fetch market details** - Use [Market Detail](/pages/discovery/market-detail) to get rules, fees, and resolution criteria before integrating with venue APIs

## Base URLs

- **REST**: `https://api.predexon.com/v1`
- **WebSocket**: `wss://stream.predexon.com/v1`

## Authentication

All requests require an API token in the authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

Contact [support@predexon.com](mailto:support@predexon.com) to request API credentials.

## Conventions

### Time Format
ISO-8601 UTC timestamps (e.g., `2025-10-06T19:21:02Z`)

### Numbers
All numeric fields are strings for fixed precision (e.g., `"0.0010"`, `"1.00"`)

### Pagination

Discovery endpoints use cursor-based pagination to handle large result sets.

**How it works:**
1. Make your first request with a `limit` parameter (default: 50, max: 200)
2. If more results exist, the response includes a `next_cursor` value
3. Pass that cursor in your next request to get the next page
4. Continue until `next_cursor` is `null` (you've reached the end)

**First request:**
```
GET /v1/events?category=sports/baseball/mlb&limit=100
```

**Response with cursor:**
```json
{
  "events": [...],
  "next_cursor": "eyJpZCI6MTIzNDU2fQ"
}
```

**Next page request:**
```
GET /v1/events?cursor=eyJpZCI6MTIzNDU2fQ&limit=100
```

**Note:** Backward pagination (`prev_cursor`) is not supported in the current version. Store cursors if you need to resume iteration.

### IDs

- **Canonical IDs**: `event_uid`, `market_uid` - stable identifiers maintained by Predexon
- **Venue IDs**: `venue_ids{}` - venue-specific identifiers (slugs, tickers, condition IDs) for accessing native APIs

## Status Enums

### event_status
- `scheduled` - Event is scheduled but hasn't started
- `live` - Event is currently in progress
- `resolved` - Event has concluded and results are final
- `cancelled` - Event was cancelled

### trading_status
- `open` - Market is open for trading
- `halted` - Trading is temporarily suspended
- `closed` - Market is closed (no more trading)

## Error Handling

All errors return standard HTTP status codes with JSON error responses:

- `400` - Bad Request (invalid parameters)
- `401` - Unauthorized (missing or invalid token)
- `403` - Forbidden (insufficient permissions)
- `404` - Not Found (resource doesn't exist)
- `422` - Unprocessable Entity (validation failed)
- `429` - Too Many Requests (rate limit exceeded)
- `5xx` - Server Errors (contact support)

Error responses follow this format:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "type": "invalid_parameter",
    "message": "date must be in YYYY-MM-DD format",
    "param": "date"
  }
}
```
