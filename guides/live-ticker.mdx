# Build a live ticker

## Overview

Create a real-time price ticker using REST snapshots and WebSocket streams.

## Architecture

1. **Initial state**: Fetch current quotes via REST
2. **Live updates**: Subscribe to WebSocket quote stream
3. **Display**: Update UI with real-time price changes

## Implementation

### Step 1: Fetch initial quotes

Use the REST API to get starting state.

Code example will be documented here.

### Step 2: Connect to WebSocket

Subscribe to the quote stream for your markets.

Code example will be documented here.

### Step 3: Handle updates

Process incoming quote deltas and update the display.

Code example will be documented here.
